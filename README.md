✅ Project 6: The Task-Master To-Do List (Web Audio API)This is a simple, browser-based To-Do list application that uses core JavaScript, the Web Audio API (Audio() constructor), and DOM manipulation. The primary feature is playing a short feedback sound ("ding") whenever a user marks a task as complete.🌟 FeaturesTask Management: Users can add, mark as done, and delete tasks.Audio Feedback: A "ding" sound plays when a task is marked done, providing auditory confirmation.(Optional) Persistence: Tasks are saved locally in the browser's localStorage to persist across sessions.💻 Technology UsedHTML5: Structure.CSS3: Styling.Vanilla JavaScript: Core logic and DOM interaction.Web API: The Audio() constructor for sound feedback.🚀 Getting StartedTo run this project locally, follow these steps:Clone the Repository:Bashgit clone [your-repo-link]
cd the-task-master
Add the Sound File:Find a small, short audio clip (like a bell or ding) and save it in the root directory of the project.Crucially, name this file exactly ding.mp3.Open the File:Open the index.html file in your web browser.📂 File StructureFile NameDescriptionindex.htmlThe main HTML structure.a.cssThe styling file.b.jsThe core JavaScript application logic.ding.mp3The sound file required for the audio feedback feature.💡 Key Learning PointsThis project is a great demonstration of several fundamental Web development concepts:DOM Manipulation: Creating, appending, and removing list items (<li>) dynamically.Handling User Input: Capturing text input and button clicks.Click Events: Implementing and distinguishing between multiple event handlers on a single element (toggling status vs. deletion).Basic Audio Integration: Using the built-in Audio() API to play a small sound for user feedback.Local Storage: Implementing the optional feature to save and load state using localStorage.setItem() and localStorage.getItem().
